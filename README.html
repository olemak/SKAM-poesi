<p>Olemak&#39;s personal website. Changes a lot, will usually contain tech demos; maybe a blog at some point.</p>
<h2 id="right-now-it-s-a-poetry-generator-">Right now, it&#39;s a poetry generator!</h2>
<p>I found out that The Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation has an open API for all their subtitles, and they subtitle <em>everything</em>.
So I figured I could grab a few subtitles and mess with them to make a cutup-style pseudo-poetry generator.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it uses React.js to display the poems and also to switch between different subtitle sources (programmes).
Naturally, the results are very different for a teen drama like &quot;Skam&quot; (&quot;Shame&quot;) or a nature show.</p>
<p>It&#39;s all in Norwegian, I mostly did this for fun and learning; I could add more sources and more programmes to the select list at the top of the page, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to happen.</p>
<h2 id="controls">Controls</h2>
<p>There are two UI elements: a reload icon and a drop-down list.
<strong>The Reload Icon</strong> will compose a new poem from the subtitles already fetched from NRK.
<strong>The Dropdown</strong> will fetch subtitles for another show and make a poem based on that.</p>
<h2 id="room-for-improvement">Room for improvement</h2>
<p>Some features that could be added or expanded, are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cached subtitles</strong>. Each time a new show/programme is selected, the old subtiles are simpluy replaced by new ones piped in with ajax magic. I could potentially preserve the old subtitles if the current methor represents a load on server resources. </li>
<li><strong>Saved poems</strong>. These fleeting lines are not saved anywhere; I could have made a persistant system that also allowed link sharing to twitter, facebook et cetera, but I dont think anyone one use it. Besides, I like the fleeting nature of the &quot;poems&quot;.</li>
<li><strong>Editable poems</strong>. Lines could be reorderable and deletable, and the text could be editable. </li>
<li><strong>More sources</strong>. I could quite easily add more programmes/series, and also make it possible to choose between seasons and episodes for each supported show. It would make the UI more complicated, though, and for a fun little thing like this it&#39;s not exactly  <em>neccecary</em>. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="browser-support">Browser support</h2>
<p>Tested in Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer; other browsers should be OK as long as they&#39;re not known for iffy javascript implementations.
One caveat for<strong>Internet Explorer</strong>: The NRK subtitles are grabbed from an XML-like format (TTF: Timed Text Format) and parsed, meaning that each paragraph appears as a virtual DOM node at the time of processing, and can be console logged as such. Most browsers will gladly grab the innerHTML of virtual nodes - but not our special friend Internet Explorer. IE will only grab the innerHTML from actual, rendered DOM nodes. So for IE, I had to use the property textContent instead. This is not optimal, because the textContent will simply cut break tags and not replace them with a space. I guess I could, in a loop, create a node for each subtitle element, add it to the DOM, grab the innerHTML of it and then destroy the node again. It would be a pretty hard hit to performance, and in my opinion it is not worth it, so for this simple demo I&#39;ll chalk it up to &quot;(semi-)graceful detoriation&quot;.</p>
<p>So in IE (and other browsers that act like it) longer text elements will usually have two words mashed together without dividing whitespace. </p>
